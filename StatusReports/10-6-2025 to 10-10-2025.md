* Work on multi-station Station Manager access for SMARTrack
## 10/8/2025
* Finished adding multi-station Station Manager access for SMARTrack
	* added to sys2; Hong says they will begin testing with mobile next Monday
* Checked to see why PAXTrack SLA service could send files via FTP to local FTP server [[9-29-2025 to 10-3-2025#10/2/2025]]
	* tested connecting manually via a WinSCP.exe and got the same issue
	* checking with Jerry to see if there's any restrictions taking place

## 10/9/2025
* Started organizing projects on Asana kanban board
* Testing SMARTrack station manager multi-station access on mobile app
	* encountered issue creating a user via the website so need to test
	* tested the following:
		* [x] registering/unregistering device for home station and cross-station
		* [x] updating gate coordinates for home station and cross-station
		* [x] switching to Agent role and perform service tasks at home and cross-station
		* [ ] switching to Dispatcher role and perform dispatching services at home station and cross-station
			* [ ] encountered issue where dispatching as station manager at cross-station not working; informed Gary of issue
* continued SLA testing after Jerry restarted FTP server
	* file transfer via FTP works both with WinSCP.exe and with SLA server so can begin next part of testing (sending files to Delta test FTP server if they have one)
## 10/10/2025
* checked that FTP reports were sent successfully after SQL database had unplanned "Degraded"
* checked that Agent/Crew SMARTrack report was sent successfully
	* should add email alert to service, along with more error-catching and logging
* checked that PAXTrack emailing service was still working
	* should update error-catching, logging, and email alert for this service
* continuing to test mult-station access on mobile app
	* Gary fixed issue with dispatching as station manager at cross-station
	* encountered my own issue creating users so continuing to debug that
