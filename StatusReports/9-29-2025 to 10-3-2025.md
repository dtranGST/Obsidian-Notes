* Provided Hong with CABIN, LAV, and WATER rules for SMARTrack compliance
	* should put these in a formal document somewhere
* Added TYS data to TYS station
	* ignored TYS in FTP service reports
	* checked that FTP services were running properly

## 9/30/2025
* Worked on first draft of IntelNexus subject/report summary exported PDFs
* Informed by Hong/Jim to begin working on giving station managers multi-station access

## 10/1/2025
* Fix DataTables timing out in SMARTrack ServiceReport and ServiceReportDetails pages
	* replaced temp tables with table variables
* Work on first draft of IntelNexus subject/report summary exported PDFs

## 10/2/2025
* Fix SMARTClean issue where Dashboard Active Agent was showing wrong handset name for agent
	* stored procedure was taking last handset registered rather than last handset used
	* updated stored procedure to use AgentSessions to retrieve active agents and their handsets
* Placed PAXTrack SLA service in 158 server for testing
	* "A connection was successfully established with the server but then an error occurred during the login process. The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted"
		* SQL Server encrypts connections by default and .NET rejects the cert unless it's trusted or you explicitly tell it not to validate
			* SQL Server is using a self-signed certificate or one from an internal CA that the Windows machine doesn't trust
		* .NET 6 by default uses "Encrypt=False" for SQL connections which makes .NET 6 apps ignore certificates, which could explain why previous .NET 6 applications work but newer .NET 8 applications, which by default uses "Encrypt=True" and thus now enforces TLS encryption by default to validate SQL Server certificate chain, don't work
		* temporarily use "TrustServerCertificate=True" until a better solution is found
	* "No connection could be made because target machine actively refused it"
		* WinSCP.EXE launched successfully and tried connecting to remote host but TCP connection attempt was refused by remote server
		* need to check:
			* wrong hostname or port
			* service isn't running on server
				* if SFTP SSH server must be enabled
				* if FTP service must be installed and running
			* Firewall blocking connection
			* server not listening on that interface
		* check if can connect via WinSCP GUI
		* check with Jerry on this
* Configured Obsidian to backup to Github using Obsidian Git
	* https://forum.obsidian.md/t/the-easiest-way-to-setup-obsidian-git-to-backup-notes/51429
	* https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here
* Jim and Gary told me to make sure that empty/white space are not accepted as names for SMARTrack Trucks, Gates and Concourses
	* currently null is not accepted, but whitespace is
	* need to check other fields in SMARTrack to not accept whitespace either
