* Informed that NTAC wants to add the mapping module to their IntelNexus
	* will need to update their IntelNexus version, which appears to be before we introduced version numbers
	* will also need to update the mapping module for NTAC as well
* HCSO is going to have their trial period extended for 2 months so no need to remove their mapping module just yet
* Rob asked me to help Brian with his database questions, namely trying to use two columns as a primary key
	* did try it out, but it turns out the two columns used would result in duplicate keys anyway so Brian is going to find another way to deal with his issue
* Worked on mapping the DTOs and models in TrackerAPI
	* looked into using dependency injection for httpClient but ran into issues, first it was an issue setting the base address in Program.cs and then I keep getting 404 errors back

* Found a way to use dependency injection for httpclient in TrackerWebAPI
	* [I have to add a **trailing** forward slash to the base address, and **NO** leading forward slash in the relative path](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23438417) 
* Continued working on converting GeoFence methods for TrackerWebAPI
	* add new models for requests and responses so that DTOs used in controller-to-API service doesn't get exposed on the client side
