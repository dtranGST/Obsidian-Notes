* Helped test new Agent Titles in PAXTrack
* worked on adding basic structure to IntelNexus subject summary report
	* no formatting yet, just get basic idea down

## 10-28-2025
* worked on profile picture and basinc info portion of IntelNexus subject summary report
	* created a one-row, two-column table, with left column having the profile picture and right column having the basic info, including the name
	* issue with aligning info headers and info using tabs
		* learning to use tab stops
* received NTAC IntelNexus URLs from Tiffany for map module configuration
	* NTAC still working on setting an upgrade date

## 10-29-2025
* worked on details, addresses/residences, and sections that had a basic table
	* added headers to each section
	* tried defining styles for the basic info and headers
	* difficult to define styles for tables, so created helper methods to add and stylize tables, columns, cells, etc.
	* added header with subject name and page number
* asked Jonathan to configure map module for NTAC using yesterday's IntelNexus URLs
	* Jonathan compiled and placed them in 185 server
* prepped SMARTrack on sys1 to get v3.7.0 update (multi-station manager feature)
	* Hong/Jim said plan is to install next morning at 10am
	* mobile app and web api will be updated later
## 10-30-2025
* updated SMARTrack sys1 to v3.7.0
	* Jim/Stanley confirmed it appeared to be working
* showed current generated IntelNexus subject summary PDF example to team to show progress and ask for comments
	* suggestions include adding "confidential" watermark to document, adding agency name in header, ensuring all existing data fields in current document are included in updated document, adding date of export (current date) somewhere in header/footer, adding subject organizations and linked reports, and hiding lat/lon when map module is not installed
