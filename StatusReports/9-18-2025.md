* Madi notified that SMARTrack search page was timing out again (example given was for SLC services between 9/1 - 9/18)
* Confirmed that search page was timing out when trying to reproduce scenario
* updated [Sp_Web_GetServicesBySearch] stored procedure so that FlightsTable is a temp table (#FlightsTable) instead of a table variable (@FlightsTable)
	* learned that temp tables are much better for 1000+ records compared to table variables
* stored procedure ran much faster (~1min to about ~8 seconds!) and page isn't timing out anymore

* generated G2 report at Hong's request as part of next day (9/19) discussions on G2 FTP reports
