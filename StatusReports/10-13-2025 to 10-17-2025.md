* Finished fixing user creation bug on SMARTrack
	* checked if ViewBag.PossibleCrossStations was null and if it was set it to empty list
		* ideally should look more into what is causing this issue

## 10/14/2025
* Worked on updating PDF generation to use MigraDocs for IntelNexus
	* realized I tested it in .net 6 but IntelNexus is targeting netcore 3.1
	* decided this was the best time to update IntelNexus to target .net 8 so began working on updating IntelNexus
		* Updated to target to .NET 8
		* Updated Nuget Dependencies to latest stable that can use .NET 8
		* Moved all Startup.cs code into Program.cs
* Sent example PAXTrack SLA and SMARTrack FTP report files as requested as Delta wants to review them to see how they can use them for their own productivity

## 10/15/2025
* Continue working on updating IntelNexus to target .NET 8
	* Used dependency injection for ApplicationDbContext rather than manually instantiation ApplicationDbContext for each controller
	* Moved StoredProcedure code into ApplicationDbContext but as a partial class (similar to SMARTrack) and modified references as needed
	* Converted ActivityLogController into a dependency injected service called ActivityLogDependency and modified references as needed
	* Working on converting RepositoryController into possible service
		* currently "injecting" into AdminController

## 10/16/2025
* Looked into adding a testing suite to new PAXTrack SLA service (still not implemented yet)
	* while doing so, realized it might be best to separate report generation, ftp, emailing, and logging to file each into a separate service and test each of those functions individually before going on
	* will work on this on a later date as this new PAXTrack SLA service doesn't have a set deadline (self developed)
* the methods that AdminController was using from RepositoryController turned out to be redundant, i.e. the views making ajax calls to AdminController could just call RepositoryController instead
	* removed the repository calls in AdminController so that RepositoryController doesn't have to be "injected"
	* modified the RepositoryController calls that AdminController was calling before to better fit what the views were trying to accomplish (those views were the only ones calling these methods)
	* updated the views to call these RepositoryController methods directly
* ran into SQL Server SSL/TLS certificate trust error
	* .NET 8 is enforcing stricter TLS and certificate validation compared to .NET Core 3.1 which by default didn't enforce it
	* added TrustServerCertificate=True to connection string for development, but will need to find solution for this in production
		* asked Jonathan about this and waiting for response

## 10/17/2025
* Started working on the TrackerWebAPI to include the geofence api methods
	* looked into using/install automapper to map models and dtos, but eventually came to conclusion that manually mapping was better, so worked on manually mapping dtos to TrackerAPI models
